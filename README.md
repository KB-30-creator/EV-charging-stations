Project Title: EV Charging Stations Analysis using Power BI

Aim:
To study and interpret the electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem by designing a dashboard that highlights critical factors essential for planning and expanding EV charging infrastructure.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains 2,705 entries and 25 features, including station name, vendor, location (latitude and longitude), city, payment method, type of station and charger, and staffing status.

Background:
This dataset provides detailed information on EV charging stations located across Delhi and surrounding regions. It helps to visualize how these stations are spread geographically and operationally.

Objective:
To generate reports and perform data analysis that supports improvements, future expansion, and policy decisions related to EV infrastructure in various areas.

Scope of Work:

1.Reduce consumer wait times

2.Improve accessibility and payment options

3.Enhance service quality and customer satisfaction

4.Address uneven distribution of charging stations

5.Optimize staffing needs at charging locations

Project Description:

Conducted exploratory analysis on publicly available EV station data to identify key operational gaps and opportunities.

Focused on challenges such as user convenience, payment flexibility, and satisfaction levels, while assessing how well stations are distributed across urban areas.

Supplemented analysis by integrating additional research on vehicle types, charging preferences (hybrid vs. standard), and rural vs. urban staffing needs.

Cleaned the data by addressing missing entries, correcting inaccuracies, and removing irrelevant fields to ensure reliable insights.

Developed interactive visual dashboards in Power BI to support data-driven decisions for improving EV infrastructure and strategic planning in the Delhi region.
